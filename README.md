**Online Bank Landing Page**

This is a personal project where I recreate a landing page for an **online bank**. I chose a **Figma design** and decided to build it using HTML and CSS.

**Project Details**
- I use the **Mobile-first approach** to make the page responsive.
- All sizes are in **relative units**, not pixels.
- I use **CSS variables** for better styling control.
- The project includes **custom fonts** for a professional look.

**Prototype**
